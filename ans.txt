General question answer
1.Coding for me is  to be relaxing for solving the problem. With every new bug, you'll also get to learn a new algorithm, work with new programming language or trying out a new framework. You'll be visiting multiple sources to figure out and its a satisfying reward when the pieces are put together. It's the flow that excites me the most. Recently, I've been keeping myself busy with java script.

2.Recently, I’ve been taking up coding challenges with java script and front end . In one of the questions I faced a difficulty fetching the json file. To solve the problem, I searched through stack-
overflow GitHub.

3.My preferred development environment is vs code,Node, Bootstrap, chrome developer
tools, git hub.

4. Throughout the internship, I will not only be able to put the knowledge I've gained into
practice but will also get to be a part of a passionate community that will help me grow
personally and professionally. It's a fact that in coding, nobody knows everything. It will
be a huge boost to the confidence knowing that I would not have to do this alone
accelerating desire to learn and do more.

5. I learn from everywhere. From video tutorials on YouTube to taking up online classes,
spending extensive time on stack Overflow, Google, consulting with professors, taking
up code challenges, MDN document.
